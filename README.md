## Description

Hooks are a new feature in React v16.8. They allow you to use the state, effect and other features of React without writing a class.

This very simple example allows you to test useState and useEffect, along with some React-Bootstrap controls.

You can find a more complex example, which also uses React-Redux hooks, at [reacthooks-cryptocurrencies](https://github.com/NestorDR/reacthooks-cryptocurrencies).

#### useState
It's the React.Js hook that allows to manage states within a functional component. It would be the equivalent of **this.state** / **state** of a class component.

#### useEffect
It's the hook of React.Js that allows to carry out secondary effects in functional components. It is equivalent to **componentDidMount**, **componentDidUpdate** and **componentWillUnmount** combined, of a class component.

By using this hook, we tell React.Js that the component must do something after it is rendered.



## Available Scripts

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
